\yearexp{Jul. 2018}{}\emph{Two Hilbert Schemes in Computer Vision} (with Max Lieblich). Submitted. Preprint available at \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09332}

        
        %Abstract: We study multiview moduli problems that arise in computer vision. We show that these moduli spaces are always smooth and irreducible, in both the calibrated and uncalibrated cases, for any number of views. We also show that these moduli spaces always embed in suitable Hilbert schemes, and that these embeddings are open immersions for more than four views.
        
			\yearmo{}{}\emph{The Essential Variety Revisited} (with Ben Antiou, Max Lieblich, and Bianca Viray). In progress.
			\end{date_section}
        
        %Abstract: We give a new description of the essential variety that simultaneously recovers seminal work of Demazure and recent results of Kileel-Fløystad-Ottaviani. We use this new construction to describe  a  new  five-point  solver  for  generic  data  based  upon  generic  Grobner  bases  for  ̈symmetric  bilinear  forms.
